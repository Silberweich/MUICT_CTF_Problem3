#### Problem 3 (EASY????)
``` 
Problem Type: Reverse Engineering  
Riddle ??:  Some say a red dragon from NSA can crack an Elf. 
            Others says only a lady with black curly hair could do it,
            she is for hire, but oh so expensive.
            
            As for me, a red dragon had help me, in many battles, change
            the control flow of things, thus changing outcomes. 

            Sometimes it is much easier to patch out unwanted enemies, than deal 
            with them head-on.
